00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:28,337
Listen to me, working properly.

If you work well, I'll treat you drink

00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,227
[ALL]
General Life!

8
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,263
Regarding this issue...

00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,324
Where Chul-Bong?

10
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:54,337
- You're all useless.
- It was all my fault-General.

11
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,243
What are you saying?

12
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:02,371
I want you to be weak.

13
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:06,318
Who is the person who contributed it?

14
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,387
Cham-bok you who contributed.

15
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:13,255
I see you save our ship.

16

Jang Sa-jung come here.

17
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:25,368
Actually I did not do anything.

18
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:32,274
Do you have the expertise,
I will lift you into Vicegerent.

19
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:37,373
- I do not want.
- You have no other choice.

20
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:42,411
- Really?
- I'm giving you a great opportunity.

21
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:49,491
- I can not do anything.
- I want you to represent me catch pirates.

22
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:55,326
What? You're a sly one, are you afraid of them
so you send me to hell.

23
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:58,462
Watch your mouth, you know you're talking to
?

24
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:05,537
I'm young, I'm not married and still a virgin
.

25
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,374
Do you want revenge on my father?

26
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:16,279
You know the notorious pirates,
you take advantage of it.

27
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:19,423
Shut up, how dare you defy me!

28
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:25,455
When I was just lucky, but you misunderstand
.

29
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:31,369
- I quit the military.
- Kill him!

30
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:39,439
- Do not.
- He's been presumptuous.

31
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:44,283
He is still very young.

32
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,509
Do not be hasty.

33
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,264
Captain.

34
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,365
Hold.

35
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,472
I swear you must die.

36
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:31,485
Everything, Jang Sa-jung fight outside.

37
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,494
Come on out.

38
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,383
Basic traitor kill him!

39
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:12,255
Do not let life, kill everything!

40
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,278
Keep the ship.

41
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,389
Catch him!
Arrest that woman!

42
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:01,366
We won, you see aksiku
?

43
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,379
So who among you are the captain of this ship?

44
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:15,253
- Are you the one?
- Not me.

45
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,322
I do not know.

46
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:33,365
Yeo-wool because you've been deserving
you who decide their fate.

47
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:39,376
You represent me,
follow his orders.

48
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,343
[ALL] Ready!

49
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:53,288
See what we found.

50
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,296
I guess they all are prisoners here.

51
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:13,367
Do not be afraid, you're all safe.

52
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,344
Miss.

53
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,253
- Do not be impertinent.
- Help me, I'm looking for my son.

54
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,452
- Why did you get caught?
- I'm looking for a job.

55
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,491
They said I was only going to be a servant.

56
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:36,229
Vice captain, what should we do on their
?

57
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,245
- You're here.
- Stempelnya fall.

58
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,383
What is this?

59
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:19,277
This is all your fault, why are you careless
?

60
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,279
I do not accidentally.

61
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:13,220
If we lose the stamp
what will happen to us?

62
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,458
Did he survive?

63
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,447
3 DAYS LATER

64
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:46,390
We get a big booty
we must celebrate.

65
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,497
Let's toast to our cooperation.

66
00:12:53,372 --> 00:13:02,474
As promised, I will help you seize the throne
and I got most of this country.

67
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:08,352
As a fellow man we have big ambitions.

68
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:14,520
Now look I've got five royal seal
.

69
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:29,475
I collect a lot of money after the first
I will retire.

70
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:33,444
Seldom has an animal on board,
where did you get that dog?

71
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:39,240
This dog I got from the merchant vessel,
he just come with me.

72
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,344
We just think of him as booty.

73
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:48,418
- You're kidding right?
- We should be proud as a great pirate.

74
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,228
But why did you reject my love?

75
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,357
- Do not know shame.
- Do not know shame.

76
00:13:54,466 --> 00:14:00,336
I was so convinced
someday you will fall into my arms.

77
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,341
- Not possible.
- Why not possible?

78
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:08,504
- You've got a wife.
- True, but a real man

79
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,408
obliged to spread love everywhere.

80
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:18,447
Idiot, you're drunk, you talk nonsense
and mouth odor.

81
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,493
Do you already have children.

82
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,320
I am very responsible.

83
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:30,301
If the lady does not take the stamp of the sea,
I'd be dead.

84
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:36,272
No way, I believe the captain
not that cruel.

85
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:43,245
You're so great, you just jump into the sea
.

86
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:47,445
Compared with you, what can you do huh
?

87
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,414
- What do we do stamp it?
- Perhaps we sell.

88
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:54,516
Captain  Why not tell us?

89
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,486
Basic old drunks.

90
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:05,235
Basic useless, if not enemies
wine that will kill you.

91
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,501
Ouch, my head dizzy.

92
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:19,507
I just took mine, the bastard
usurp the throne from me.

93
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:28,358
Seize the stamp is an easy affair
but attacking another story palace.

94
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,325
Who is he?

95
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,260
Is she the palace?

96
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,426
- You'd better collect a lot of troops.
- I have to go.

97
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:43,397
- Mo Hong-gab.
- Yes.

98
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:44,499
- Choon-Sub
- Yes.

99
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,404
- Yong-hood.
- Yes.

100
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,446
- Han Sang-vol.
- Yes. I'm here.

101
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,243
-
Iiege - Yes.

102
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,316
- He Ma.
- I'm here.

103
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:58,450
I have to fast, I had no food supplies
.

104
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:03,455
Damn, once the cold night wind.

105
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,227
Get them.

106
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:11,236
- Ready!
- Get them.

107
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,236
Captain, why they were arrested?

108
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,501
They are not incompetent, almost
booty we lost.

109
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,403
I'm sorry. Captain.

110
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,415
- They have long struggled with us.
- We are pirates.

111
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,276
- This is our rule.
- Captain.

112
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:34,224
- Captain, your men were fair?
- You're not allowed to get my daughter.

113
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,327
But you should have a girl in tow.

114
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,391
- Take him.
- Do not, let go of me.

115
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,436
Do not touch me, do not!

116
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,268
Shut up.

117
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,375
- You are so cruel.
- I am your captain.

118
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:54,503
- Let go of me!
- The lives you are mine.

119
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,339
You all....

120
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,288
Kill him.

121
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:12,455
Captain, your men rebelled.

122
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:36,354
You remind me of myself.

123
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,389
You're not my father.

124
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:39,316
I know you deserve punishment.

125
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:48,520
You said it, we follow the rules
pirates pirates.

126
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:56,334
How can you survive without me?

127
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,465
I'm proud of you.

128
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,213
Get rid of that flag.

129
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:42,440
Majesty, the pirates attacked our ship
. We lost five stamps.

130
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:50,380
I want you to investigate this matter and find out
who stole it.

131
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:59,454
Royal seal is a symbol of power
lose it very embarrassing.

132
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:09,231
I made you General,
pursue and destroy the pirates.

133
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:16,414
Live His Majesty!

134
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:32,328
- Finally I became General also.
- It should be celebrated.

135
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,297
- But I'm still confused.
- About what?

136
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,331
Where we have to look for the pirates?

137
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:46,301
The oceans are very large, we do not even have a clue
.

138
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,473
How can we find them?

139
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:55,414
Leave it to me.

140
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,518
- What is it?
- There is something approaching.

141
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:09,399
I want all the soldiers getting in
positions respectively.

142
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,232
Prepare for war!

143
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,397
Ready!

144
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:19,275
Shoot arrows!

145
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:36,256
- It was gray whales.
- It's our lucky day.

146
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:40,490
- Kill the whales!
- Kill the whales!

147
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,420
- Damn. Shoot the cannon!
- Shoot the cannon!

148
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,455
Shoot the cannon!

149
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:29,275
That's it, do not let him get away!

150
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:33,512
Artillerymen, shoot!
- Shoot!

151
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,353
- My ship.
- Captain.

152
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,415
Stempelku.

153
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:36,505
Stempelku, he swallowed it.

154
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:46,483
Where are you guys?
I want to eat!

155
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:55,425
Come I will not hurt you.

156
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:59,301
Where are you guys?

157
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,273
Let me eat you.

158
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,469
I'm so hungry.

159
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:15,309
It's been a long time I did not eat.

160
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,385
Help me.

161
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,533
We caught him in the woods.

162
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:45,443
So tell me, who are you?

163
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:53,447
I am member of the pirate Black Crow
brave,

164
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:59,327
If you do not let go of me,
my friends will find me.

165
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:07,433
I can not guarantee your safety
so for your own sake, be wise.

166
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,301
Gosh, you're good at boasting.

167
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:16,278
- You look like a fool.
- What?

168
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:23,479
My friend said I was cute.

169
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:28,383
The woman also likes me.

170
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,353
I do not lie.

171
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:37,231
- I believe.
- Do you believe?

172
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,472
- It's you cerdasjuga.
- I believe you're stupid.

173
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:47,210
- I guess it's not funny.
- Hey you.

174
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:50,304
Why are you here?

175
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:57,415
A very long story.

176
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:06,328
Actually captain conspired with someone and he wants to kill us all.

177
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:11,459
I accidentally heard it
so I went on the boat before I was killed.

178
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:21,338
I'm sure he's a palace,
because he wanted to seize the throne.

179
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,473
If I see him again I will kill him.

180
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,517
Enough .

181
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:33,519
Your story is true or not, does not become a problem
.

182
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:37,295
You will become a servant at the camp.

183
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:43,223
I refused, I am the person dignity,
I do not want to be a slave.

184
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:47,499
- Quick work funny guy.
- Why do not you first looked in the mirror?

185
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,467
What did you say?

186
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:05,251
There is an important issue.
Majesty seems angry.

187
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:18,260
What? You all can not get it!
What have you done!

188
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:20,427
Ampun! Mercy.

189
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:25,402
What do you think?

190
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:32,340
Actually there is nothing I can think again,
I do not want to get involved in this issue.

191
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,476
What do you mean?

192
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:44,518
Do not like it,
no need to get upset like that to me.

193
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:52,226
I'll help you.
But I'm in danger.

194
00:27:56,541 --> 00:28:08,385
Anything else? There is nothing you can do anymore.
Do not you remember yesterday's events?

195
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:16,418
You're not going to be involved.
Do you remember back.

196
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:21,298
What has been done by him?

197
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:30,441
- Ampun! Forgive me, Your Majesty!
- What is it? Why do you ask for forgiveness?

198
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:40,383
I've been guilty of letting him get away from my hand.

199
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:49,489
I've caught him and held him.
But I was not able to run the task.

200
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:51,487
What?

201
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:55,294
- Majesty.
- You're it.

202
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:59,201
You're not useless at all!

203
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:06,472
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
But I brought this for you.

204
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:14,274
What is this? What are you taking me?
This is an insult!

205
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:21,484
- You know what I mean by all this?
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

206
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,458
- Why be like this?
- Forgive me, Your Majesty!

207
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:32,429
I also ask for forgiveness, Your Honor.
I please do not punish him.

208
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:36,332
You do not need to interfere!
You also will I cut off!

209
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:48,443
I do not want to know, you must
catch back dead or alive.

210
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:52,353
- Well, Your Honor. But...
- Do it!

211
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:54,483
Do it as soon as possible.

212
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:01,262
- You all understand?
- Yes, Your Honor.

213
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:11,331
I know I'll be able to get away with
easily from there. Just with anything.

214
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,275
- Magna.
- Yes.

215
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:20,478
You have prepared a net for them.

216
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:24,249
We will catch them.

217
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:40,461
Chairman, is not it better
aja we attack directly.

218
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:46,437
- You do not say anything, you do not understand anything.
- Why is it always like that?

219
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,318
They are coming.

220
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:11,369
- Cut now. Yes, cut.
- Cut now? Cut?

221
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:18,365
- Cut now. True. Do it.
- Now also?

222
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:28,318
- What an idiot. Come retreat.
- Backward. Backward.

223
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:35,314
What's up?

224
00:31:56,514 --> 00:32:00,507
Come all! Attack!
Let's attack!

225
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,427
Tankap them!
Catch!

226
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:27,370
Alas! Let's spread!
Let's all spread out!

227
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,318
Chairman!

228
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:42,254
- Arrows over there!
- Over there!

229
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,495
Do not leave me, chief!

230
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:51,461
- Do not leave me, chief!
- Capture!

231
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:56,396
Go there.
Come on, come on!

232
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:59,239
Do not run!

233
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,279
- You run over there!
- Wait for me, chief!

234
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:07,475
Exhausting all.

235
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:15,317
- That was a stupid act.
- I also do not understand his command.

236
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:20,487
I told you not to cut it.
But you do it anyway.

237
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,459
Why be like this?

238
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:31,502
So all because of him.
All failed because of an error he.

239
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:38,448
Why do you keep blaming everyone else?
You are planning all this.

240
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,251
But you blame the other person.

241
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:53,259
Just kidding.
You do not need to upset anyone else.

242
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,491
And they could not chase us.

243
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:58,460
We've escaped.

244
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:03,238
Chairman, Chairman.
Look, look, over there.

245
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:10,373
- They're still chasing us.
- True sekai. What now?

246
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:14,351
What now?
What should we do now?

247
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,353
Chairman.

248
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,364
I in live again.

249
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:45,440
What this really him?

250
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,288
You're lucky.

251
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:07,337
- I have an important task for you.
- What can I do?

252
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,400
You have to kill someone.

253
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:19,281
If you can do it, I will membebaskamu.
It was an attractive offer.

254
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:27,348
- That's why I say you're lucky.
- Very true, very lucky.

255
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:46,300
You'd better enjoy this dish first, new
you do your job.

256
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,515
I wanted to do it.

257
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:01,458
- What now?
- I'm sure he succeeded.

258
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,462
You do not have to worry.

259
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:21,310
- What did you come here?
- I want to say something.

260
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:33,415
What is it? You say it directly.
No need to wait anymore.

261
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:44,530
I want to convey a
information that may be useful to armadamu.

262
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:47,271
You're so lucky.

263
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:54,436
If that information is quite useful for
aramdaku, I would be very grateful.

264
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:59,410
There will be ships that will attack you.

265
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:14,296
Ship what? Ships which can beat the greatness of my ship's
? That is very great.

266
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:19,435
- You're not messing with me, right?
- Bastard.

267
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:28,334
- You are too arrogant.
- It is true, what if I'm arrogant?

268
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:36,409
You know, you're no match for me.
You will never defeat me.

269
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:45,328
- We can not let this happen. Come in action.
- You do not like it.

270
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:49,355
- You do not need to interfere.
- He was abs.

271
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:55,398
We have to be patient first.
When it was time we will attack.

272
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:01,505
- When is the right time?
- Immediately.

273
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:51,489
Let's go.

274
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:58,494
I really like in here, there is so much food
.

275
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:12,282
- What creature is that?
- Come on, do not be in view.

276
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:20,313
- I'm sure the creature is not from here.
- Come on we have to keep moving.

277
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:32,300
And I do it like this.
I like it vibrates.

278
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:42,438
Do you like my story?
Are you impressed with kehebatanku?

279
00:39:52,323 --> 00:40:00,321
- What is it? If you do what I can.
- No need to worry. We're not trying to kill you.

280
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,467
Do you want something?

281
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:06,269
Information.

282
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:14,278
- You'd better say it.
- I do not know anything.

283
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:16,278
You should remove me.

284
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:28,391
- If you do not let me go, feel the consequences.
- It's just talk.

285
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:39,294
Ampun! Well, I would say.
But this information is not free.

286
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:44,338
- I want something in return.
- What is it? Katakanllah.

287
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:47,377
You let go of me first.
I will soon tell you.

288
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:55,375
- He wants to trick us.
- I promise.

289
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,452
What?

290
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:20,401
What's up? No longer met.
What brought you here?

291
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:30,453
I'm fine.
And what is that.

292
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:41,288
Why do you still like it?
Do not you miss me?

293
00:41:55,479 --> 00:42:03,511
Relax. No need to like it.
We have not met.

294
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:12,353
I'm do not want to mess around.
I'm here to do something.

295
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:21,301
Why do you still like it?
Not at all alert.

296
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:28,434
How?
Do you still do the little things?

297
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:37,444
Looks like the night would be long.

298
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:49,527
All here. I hope you can help.
Tell me what you know information?

299
00:42:50,301 --> 00:43:02,338
Of course, there is an information for all of these.
Only, it seems this is not enough.

300
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,307
- Really?
- This is a very valuable information.

301
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:19,490
And also there are others who would like information
I got this. You may have to pay more.

302
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:27,370
How much do you want?
What all this is not enough?

303
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:36,371
Say. Or you not be able to go from here
.

304
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:41,375
- Okay.
- Good.

305
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:48,323
Shit, he caught it.

306
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:56,290
Slow down, we will get it back.
No need to worry.

307
00:43:56,367 --> 00:44:00,235
- What do you mean?
- Listen, you first patient.

308
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:13,341
I want to tell you something.
And this story a long time before the kingdom.

309
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:17,477
- It may already be a legend now.
- You're just bragging!

310
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:23,382
- What?
- I just wanted to come here.

311
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:31,265
And this seems to have matured.
It's time to enjoy it.

312
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:36,434
Okay, everything is ready.

313
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:51,412
Actually no I want to say to you
all, I hope you are not surprised by it.

314
00:44:57,461 --> 00:45:02,296
- Well, you say it.
- What would you say?

315
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:11,238
- What is important? - Of course, very important.
- Come on, just say it already.

316
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:13,502
- Do you want to hear?
- You listen wrote him first.

317
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:17,475
- Come on, the better we all sit down.
- Come on, just say it.

318
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:22,480
- Never mind tomorrow.
- I'm sorry, I'm sleepy.

319
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:31,426
What you would all that much gold?

320
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,298
All right, listen up. Come listen.

321
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:42,497
- What do you mean?
- What are you talking about?

322
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:46,333
- Come on, you say.
- Are not you sleepy?

323
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:52,374
- You say it, or I'll get out of here!
- Okay.

324
00:45:55,486 --> 00:46:00,321
- How do you say?
- Damn, what do you mean?

325
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:05,418
- Let's say, come quickly.
- Maybe we should put it off until tomorrow.

326
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:22,471
What do you mean? Do you want to fight me?
Are you dare to fight me? You're great?

327
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:24,405
Forgive me.

328
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:36,350
I'm sorry, I have to hit him.
Come on, you say that now.

329
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:39,462
Right.

330
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,494
But you put it first.

331
00:46:54,311 --> 00:47:09,352
What is not there is honor?
What you all have dared to fight me?

332
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:14,319
- What you want to do exactly?
- What?

333
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:25,503
- Like it alone.
- True. It was easy as pie.

334
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:30,440
But we do not have enough strength.

335
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:37,317
- That's why I like you.
- What do you mean?

336
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:42,220
We can do it, if we want to.

337
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:50,257
You're great to talk,
, you see, we are short of people.

338
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:55,428
- Are you kidding?
- He was funny once.

339
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,474
- Calm down, calm down.
- Calm?

340
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:09,281
Okay, here we go.
Who wants to join?

341
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:19,361
- You do not always want to hit people.
- Never mind.

342
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:23,331
He was always like that.
Always show sinister faces.

343
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:30,397
Do you hear, there is nothing to fear.

344
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:41,341
I always follow your words,
like that time I always take care of you.

345
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:54,492
- It should you like it.
- Who told talk? And I did all that.

346
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:59,496
- Great all.
- Of course.

347
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:11,438
- Always nonsense. I've had it with you.
- You do not need to do that! Come on!

348
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:18,287
Do you challenge me? Come on!
Come on, do not you run.

349
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:41,234
Actually I want to say,
I love you all like brothers.

350
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:49,408
I'm willing to sacrifice this for my brothers.
Whatever will I do for my brother.

351
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:53,252
Although should do it all.

352
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:09,396
All the things I would do. Everything.
All will I face for my brother.

353
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,373
Everything.

354
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:27,423
And you do not realize it.
All sacrifice.

355
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:35,422
- What are you doing?
- You've finished? What I have to end?

356
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:40,225
End?
Never mind do not mess around.

357
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,398
Tomorrow, we will act.

358
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:57,514
This is very useful in long-range combat.

359
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:02,350
And over there.

360
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:14,500
A very great thing once.
It can kill in an instant.

361
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:23,378
And right here. A new object.
It was great once.

362
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:33,312
Can
kill many enemies with a single attack from afar.

363
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:42,364
Do you already know what you want?

364
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:50,240
This is very dangerous. Over here.
There are other things I want to show you.

365
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,503
Note.
See the fine.

366
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:59,212
Enemies will not get away from this.
We recommend that you back off a little.

367
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:06,387
You take it easy, I'm not okay.

368
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:08,354
What are you doing?

369
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:10,486
You hit the arrow...

370
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:43,356
What is it?

371
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,452
Blast what is it?

372
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:10,476
He's the one.

373
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:16,392
It is very difficult.

374
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:20,252
How can you survive?

375
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,299
Arrow is not painful.

376
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:26,493
Give me a break.

377
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:38,471
Hey, are you ready?

378
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,244
Yes.

379
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:42,308
Come on, here we go!

380
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,344
Come on!

381
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:59,298
Prepare everything.

382
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:01,462
We will sail soon.

383
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:04,432
Prepare our weapons.

384
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:22,289
Tell them to keep pace.

385
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,518
We will soon be up.

386
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:26,256
Hoist screen.

387
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,375
I'm so tired.

388
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:24,478
Finally we arrived.

389
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:35,456
This is not the end of our adventure.

390
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:39,424
This is just the beginning of our adventure.

391
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:42,266
You're all still excited.

392
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:44,363
We're going to win.

393
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:48,275
Show me all your passion!

394
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:51,540
With all our strength.

395
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,451
Come sail!

396
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,249
Come on!

397
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:02,415
- What?
- What would you like to ask again?

398
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:04,256
You should pay attention to.

399
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,394
It hurts.

400
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:27,373
Majesty...

401
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:31,510
They made it to shore

402
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:35,414
Majesty not to worry.

403
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:39,325
Soldiers we have been pursuing them.

404
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:43,491
This problem will soon be completed.

405
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,460
Do not worry.

406
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:49,437
We have sent the best soldiers

407
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,269
they will not fail.

408
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:55,435
We will promptly notify you.

409
01:01:57,313 --> 01:02:01,306
Good. Immediately
finish this task.

410
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:05,285
And make sure they are all dead.

411
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:07,255
Do not forgive them.

412
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,484
Do you understand?

413
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:16,329
Sucks.

414
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:20,334
He can only commands us alone.

415
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:23,497
Do not complain too much.

416
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:25,337
Right.

417
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:28,275
What do you think?

418
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:31,312
Do you even think about it?

419
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:35,508
Because of this, our plan was all messed up.

420
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:41,422
Do you have other plans?

421
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:44,357
Tell me if you've got...

422
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,486
Can not you shut up for a moment?

423
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:52,267
You are disturbing my concentration.

424
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:57,463
Are you tired of living?

425
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,410
Not...

426
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:03,401
But those guys got away...

427
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,474
I excused myself.

428
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:47,320
These workers worked very diligently.

429
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:50,291
I'm sure this will be completed soon.

430
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:57,330
Soon... soon finish this.

431
01:03:57,533 --> 01:04:03,233
Take it easy. It will be completed
as you wish.

432
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:04,500
I can not wait.

433
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:09,333
I can not wait to see the results of your work.

434
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:13,371
Right. I understand.

435
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:20,288
Soon I could sail.

436
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:39,273
Hey! Hey!

437
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:44,244
You can not drink the water.

438
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:47,239
I'm thirsty.

439
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:00,386
- Sharks!
- Sharks.

440
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:02,488
- There are sharks!
- What should we do?

441
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:06,262
The shark will come here.

442
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:07,530
We have to fight.

443
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:10,397
- Kill the shark!
- Be prepared!

444
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:13,499
He came! Oh, No!

445
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:20,347
It's falling!

446
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:22,280
Hold on!

447
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,247
Sharks are coming!
Do something!

448
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:31,260
Hold this rope!

449
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:35,396
Hold on!

450
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:54,249
We made it!

451
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:55,443
We kill the shark!

452
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:58,249
We survived!

453
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:15,430
Like I expected.

454
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:20,499
Yes, sir. This ship is very strong.

455
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:25,437
Now, we just need to find the target.

456
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:30,309
This ship will be the fastest ship...

457
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:32,447
What's that noise?

458
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,256
I do not hear anything.

459
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:36,450
Ship what is it?

460
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,488
It was weird.

461
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:44,399
Hold on! Hang in there!

462
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,426
Kill her!

463
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:48,334
Kill!

464
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:52,430
The bullet fell!

465
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:55,274
Let's turn it on!

466
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:58,246
We will die !

467
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,443
- Fast! Fast!
- Can not turn on.

468
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,315
It lights up!

469
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:10,451
- Attack them.
- Attack them!

470
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:15,419
- We're going to die.
- Do not say that.

471
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:29,302
- Shoot them!
- Shoot them!

472
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:39,352
Who are they?
What did he want them?

473
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:42,257
I do not understand.

474
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:46,227
Who? They?

475
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:08,508
Finally, it's over.

476
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:10,451
Help me pull the rope.

477
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:17,223
I'm not sure about this.

478
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:21,362
He is still alive!

479
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:36,503
- What is it?
- The shark is dead.

480
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:40,505
- We managed to kill the shark!
- We managed to kill him!

481
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:43,510
We're great!

482
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:47,216
It's just a fish.

483
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,281
What should we do with this shark?

484
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:56,431
Is it edible?

485
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:59,491
I never eat it, is not that nice?

486
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:02,327
We do not even know how to cook it.

487
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:05,340
Maybe we could just burn it.

488
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:07,332
What did you say?

489
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:09,344
No need to worry about.

490
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:16,207
Meat
for this may be enough for us all to eat.

491
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:19,312
Maybe we can leave for the needs.

492
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:43,470
What happened?

493
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,406
Why could explode?

494
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:50,417
We're ready to shoot.

495
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:00,319
We're about her!

496
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,463
Shot sangatjitu.

497
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:28,254
Guarding her very strict.

498
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:32,426
If we get caught, we're going to be put to death.

499
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:35,521
I hear they are very cruel.

500
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:39,365
Hey, listen. I have a plan.

501
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:41,266
Say it.

502
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:44,235
We can divert their attention.

503
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:45,501
Who will distract them?

504
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:47,304
We can pretend to be dead.

505
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:49,402
They will not care about the dead.

506
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:52,275
There might be another way.

507
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:54,415
Think about it.

508
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:59,253
We can not wait anymore.

509
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:01,285
You'll do it.

510
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:03,491
True at all...

511
01:11:08,397 --> 01:11:12,356
Are you sure  with a plan like this?

512
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:14,492
I need some people.

513
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,397
Please.

514
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:21,307
Him. Him.

515
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:27,281
Do not pretend sad when I see you.

516
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:30,318
You are making me like this.

517
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:33,386
Do not fight.

518
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:37,316
Right.

519
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:40,419
After I distract them,

520
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,487
you should immediately go.

521
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:46,393
And then I'll
hiding somewhere.

522
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:48,428
And swim like...

523
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,341
You should, too.

524
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:57,402
Can you do it?

525
01:11:57,446 --> 01:12:02,315
With so they will not notice it.

526
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:05,386
Then we'll sneak.

527
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:10,391
Then one person would go and sneak.

528
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:13,259
Then steal the treasure.

529
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:18,390
While others watched from outside
to keep you.

530
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:24,269
If it's safe,
we will give you a sign.

531
01:12:24,306 --> 01:12:27,400
But you should not be up ketauan.

532
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:31,404
Defeat  some guards.

533
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:42,252
Do not forget to ask for forgiveness.

534
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:45,316
After that we definitely made it into the main room.

535
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:48,487
In a food storage warehouse.

536
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:54,332
Then we sprinkle oil all over the place
then fled from there.

537
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:58,500
- Okay.
- You always say that & apos; & apos; Well & apos; & apos ;.

538
01:12:58,507 --> 01:13:01,237
Give me a little advice.

539
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:04,277
Do not always accept the suggestions,

540
01:13:04,313 --> 01:13:06,281
You is its chairman.

541
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:09,441
You are supposed to do this.

542
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:23,327
My lord, it's safe.

543
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,368
Fixed Heightened security.

544
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:28,470
Do not let anyone escape.

545
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:33,468
Harden guard!

546
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:42,383
What is this?

547
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,511
Why do they patrol?
What is it?

548
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,420
See it!

549
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:50,221
Are they aware of our existence?

550
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:52,420
It is not possible.

551
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:55,487
Has he been caught?

552
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:18,352
My lord, look at that!

553
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:20,312
It!

554
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:23,323
No way!

555
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:55,483
He came!

556
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:57,492
Prepare everything. He came.

557
01:14:57,526 --> 01:15:01,292
Immediately hoist screen!

558
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,456
Quick!

559
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:05,400
Quick. Quick.

560
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:07,297
Who are you?

561
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:11,268
Fast, fast, fast, fast.

562
01:15:15,477 --> 01:15:17,445
Get out of here!

563
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:30,424
Chairman!

564
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:36,293
Less sharp knife.

565
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:49,342
Quick jump!

566
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:53,371
Death to you all!

567
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:09,397
Kill him!

568
01:16:17,472 --> 01:16:19,406
Turns out you!

569
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:22,333
Why are you messing my kingdom?

570
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:25,244
Hurry up!

571
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,440
I do not know it's you here.

572
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:29,348
You dare to mess up my place.

573
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:33,250
Do you forget who you are?

574
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:35,422
Death to you!

575
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:56,477
Look at you, you're even still weak.

576
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:58,536
I'm not going to lose again.

577
01:17:10,492 --> 01:17:13,427
Come on.
Quick! Hurry!

578
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:16,423
Hurry!

579
01:17:22,504 --> 01:17:27,271
- Hyeon Chung!
- Catch it!

580
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:30,344
Pull! Pull!

581
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,405
Yikes!

582
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:36,284
Yikes!

583
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:38,444
Let's go!
We will meet again!

584
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:53,266
What is news?

585
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,360
We missed the boat again.

586
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,500
It could not be anymore.

587
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:04,370
This is a very clever pirate.

588
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:09,382
He came from the darkness of night.
And attacked my ship.

589
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:15,447
I do not care, we should be able to secure the region
, but should only patrol boat.

590
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:18,359
We are short of troops.

591
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:21,257
We can not give a lot of patrol boats.

592
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:23,320
Do you understand the situation?

593
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:28,326
But if this continues, we will ship damaged
continue.

594
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:30,462
Do you want to sacrifice our ship?

595
01:18:36,244 --> 01:18:38,371
We'll see.

596
01:18:49,357 --> 01:18:51,484
Secure all of this!

597
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:55,320
We know this village plotting with
pirates.

598
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,469
Mother!

599
01:19:05,373 --> 01:19:07,432
Come on, go!

600
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:10,273
Come on!

601
01:19:10,445 --> 01:19:14,472
See this.
This is not good,

602
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:24,255
All we would swim.
Find and grab as much as possible.

603
01:19:24,526 --> 01:19:27,256
Let's do it.

604
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:39,332
There is a whale!

605
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:45,241
It's right there!
Quick look.

606
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:50,214
- Wow.
- Great once.

607
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:53,479
- It was huge!
- Yes!

608
01:19:57,259 --> 01:19:58,487
Do not miss!

609
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:13,339
Captain? What can?

610
01:20:15,343 --> 01:20:18,312
Not. What is it?

611
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:19,347
Not. Stop.

612
01:20:23,418 --> 01:20:26,478
That she is the parent.

613
01:20:27,255 --> 01:20:28,279
What?

614
01:20:29,257 --> 01:20:32,522
Yes. But, it is very dear.
We have to.

615
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:34,421
What else can we eat?

616
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:39,466
This rare opportunity for us
get this food.

617
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:41,530
Captain?

618
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:44,498
Yes, how?

619
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:50,342
Not.
Do it now.

620
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,341
Stand. We're sorry.

621
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:12,459
That pirate ship.

622
01:21:19,274 --> 01:21:20,468
What do you think?

623
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:29,449
This is really nice.

624
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:33,476
Very quiet and beautiful.

625
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:36,483
I want to meet him.

626
01:21:37,492 --> 01:21:41,223
See, there will be plenty of food.
He ​​must be happy.

627
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:47,290
Hey .. Hey ..
What are you doing? Correct.

628
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:51,338
- It was the wind.
- You're wrong movement.

629
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:54,307
It is very difficult.

630
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:57,469
- Just rotate.
- You know it's hard.

631
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:00,339
He's just talk.
You're trying to do.

632
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:04,281
- This is so weird.
- You see the captain came.

633
01:22:04,386 --> 01:22:06,513
He would have been furious.
You do not really work.

634
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:10,485
Forgive us, captain.

635
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:14,387
But you know it's hard.

636
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:20,428
Yes, nice. We can relax alone.

637
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:23,494
Nothing serious, we can party.

638
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:28,265
- Partying!
- Yes. That's right.

639
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:31,335
- You just talk.
- That's right.

640
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:38,248
You stupid bastards do not know anything.

641
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:43,257
Do you realize? It is difficult, stupid!

642
01:23:00,442 --> 01:23:02,433
This is just a joke.

643
01:23:03,411 --> 01:23:06,437
You see it there.

644
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:17,414
Kill it! I'm afraid!

645
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:20,426
Look at him! That's not possible.

646
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:28,258
Good. This is great.
He's harmless.

647
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:30,235
It is not dangerous?

648
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:32,398
It was very big at all.

649
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:38,235
I know. He could swallow us directly.

650
01:23:39,481 --> 01:23:41,312
Sure.

651
01:23:41,483 --> 01:23:46,284
But he  benign.
So safe.

652
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:53,453
- What Really?
- Yes, I really do. He was benign, not usa fear.

653
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:56,423
Basic coward.

654
01:23:57,298 --> 01:24:00,358
- You, damn! You're damn.
- What?

655
01:24:00,468 --> 01:24:04,404
What scares you?
For what?

656
01:24:05,273 --> 01:24:09,300
You know damn sick!
It's not my fault!

657
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:13,313
Yes, you see it. It's you!
Get him!

658
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:20,347
Bitch!
Damn. Cheeky! You're dead!

659
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:28,429
What the damn?

660
01:24:29,364 --> 01:24:31,298
What is it?

661
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:34,468
We pirates north.

662
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:37,363
We will all treasure.

663
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:44,469
We want it all!
I want you.

664
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:51,385
- It can not be left off.
- I do not want the old man.

665
01:24:51,486 --> 01:24:54,319
How is this?

666
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:59,359
We will not be silent.
We are opposed to them.

667
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:02,294
- How?
- Do not be hasty.

668
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:04,263
We see the situation.

669
01:25:04,332 --> 01:25:05,390
We need to find a way.

670
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:10,362
Souma!

671
01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:15,375
If we attack what would you
forgive us and free us?

672
01:25:16,377 --> 01:25:24,375
I will let it, we will see later.
How? Depending on you.

673
01:25:24,419 --> 01:25:29,220
- There's another boat coming.
- Hey!

674
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:36,387
This is fun. Relaxed.

675
01:25:36,498 --> 01:25:42,403
- Yes, that's right. Let it relax.
- That's right.

676
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:45,462
True. Ya. Really.

677
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:48,275
Really good. Ya.

678
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:51,243
You are absolutely right. It's good.

679
01:25:52,413 --> 01:25:57,510
What is it actually true? You know we
just lazy. Do not want to work.

680
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:01,288
We're not going to get into trouble if we do not look for it
.

681
01:26:01,389 --> 01:26:03,254
Yes, yes. That's right.

682
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:06,486
- It was great.
- Yes.

683
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:10,230
What is this?

684
01:26:20,542 --> 01:26:23,409
Hi, how are you?

685
01:26:23,478 --> 01:26:26,379
Fuck it here!

686
01:26:27,248 --> 01:26:31,412
- Hey, it's you.
- Brother, we could use him.

687
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:36,252
We better look here.

688
01:26:36,357 --> 01:26:40,453
Yes, great, let's go!
All attack!

689
01:26:58,346 --> 01:27:01,440
- Come on now!
- How?

690
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:03,410
To get there!

691
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:05,418
Attack!

692
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,385
Come on! Attack!

693
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:16,520
Do you miss me?

694
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:26,465
Yes, this cut.

695
01:27:27,275 --> 01:27:30,438
Hurry!
You help me!

696
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:49,361
- This is not good, we had to escape.
- Yes.

697
01:27:51,299 --> 01:27:54,291
I pastor.
Do not attack me.

698
01:27:55,303 --> 01:27:58,466
It forgive me.

699
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:02,504
This is a nice safe.

700
01:28:04,412 --> 01:28:09,406
Why did you all go? Hey
. Why does this go?

701
01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:31,338
You lose! Finally.

702
01:28:31,372 --> 01:28:34,307
He already lost!

703
01:28:53,294 --> 01:28:55,421
Great. Welcome.

704
01:28:58,466 --> 01:29:00,229
Who are you?

705
01:29:00,301 --> 01:29:02,201
I Chang Hyeon.

706
01:29:02,303 --> 01:29:03,235
I'm happy for you.

707
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:05,272
Chang Hyeon.

708
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:10,409
Good. We know you're extraordinary.

709
01:29:10,545 --> 01:29:14,481
I'm happy for you, you're great.

710
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:18,319
Come all, welcome!

711
01:29:21,422 --> 01:29:24,289
Mr. ..

712
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:33,291
You all will be my slave.

713
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:39,406
You have to work.
However the two of you must die!

714
01:29:39,474 --> 01:29:44,309
I do not care, as long as you forgive my crew.

715
01:29:44,512 --> 01:29:51,475
- I'm willing to die.
- Yes, it's good for you as captain.

716
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:56,356
You should give up and be my woman.

717
01:29:56,491 --> 01:29:59,426
It was a great idea.

718
01:29:59,494 --> 01:30:03,294
This is great, we can end peacefully.

719
01:30:03,431 --> 01:30:05,422
This is really good for all.

720
01:30:05,466 --> 01:30:07,525
Not. This is the captain of the ship must die.

721
01:30:08,469 --> 01:30:11,370
You have to die.

722
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:15,204
Yes, if so.

723
01:30:17,278 --> 01:30:18,438
Can you forgive me.

724
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:23,240
I can not, I think you should die.

725
01:30:24,385 --> 01:30:28,481
- And what do you want?
- I think I'm better off dead.

726
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:34,456
This honor dead captain.
I want to die honorably.

727
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:37,390
This is the only remaining honor.

728
01:30:37,498 --> 01:30:39,363
Oh,

729
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:42,327
Then I went with him.

730
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,337
For the honor.

731
01:30:45,339 --> 01:30:48,240
- Well.
- Yes.

732
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:50,468
I have not...

733
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:56,383
Captain!

734
01:32:25,339 --> 01:32:27,466
Please.

735
01:32:31,479 --> 01:32:34,346
I know you will succeed.

736
01:32:34,448 --> 01:32:42,253
I'm happy to serve my master with this easy problem
.

737
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:48,292
I'm just asking for a little reward alone,

738
01:32:50,298 --> 01:32:56,362
- Yes, this is a form of loyalty.
- I think it's inappropriate.

739
01:32:57,305 --> 01:33:01,298
- I asked for freedom of the seas.
- This is a big demand.

740
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:05,334
I think this is hard I gave.

741
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:10,240
- What else do I ..
- You're just as my legs.

742
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:14,413
No more than that alone.

743
01:33:17,525 --> 01:33:21,393
Yes, I guess it was not bad.

744
01:33:21,462 --> 01:33:23,487
I'm interested.

745
01:33:24,298 --> 01:33:27,392
- What?
- I want to pay half of the shipping.

746
01:33:28,235 --> 01:33:30,294
Which it from you.

747
01:33:30,404 --> 01:33:32,235
Lord.

748
01:35:38,265 --> 01:35:41,428
Yes? What's this?
We are in the second kubuh.

749
01:35:42,269 --> 01:35:46,262
Why you can not be silent,
We are all prisoners.

750
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:50,367
Hey. we are not a loser like you.

751
01:35:50,478 --> 01:35:54,437
Do you? Asshole all.

752
01:35:54,515 --> 01:35:58,474
Hey, did you know you lost.

753
01:35:59,253 --> 01:36:02,416
Ah, you're a useless sycophant.

754
01:36:02,490 --> 01:36:03,457
What?

755
01:36:03,524 --> 01:36:07,460
Come! You do, we do not fear.
Did you know we dare!

756
01:36:08,295 --> 01:36:11,230
Really?

757
01:36:12,233 --> 01:36:13,291
Do it!

758
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:15,368
Gosh ! You think we're scared.

759
01:36:15,469 --> 01:36:19,337
- What do you want to die?
- Come on, attack!

760
01:36:19,473 --> 01:36:22,237
What are you afraid of? You're a coward sea!

761
01:36:22,343 --> 01:36:24,436
- You what?
- Mud sea!

762
01:36:24,512 --> 01:36:26,309
We mud?

763
01:36:26,413 --> 01:36:29,246
- You're a squid.
- Weak!

764
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:31,409
Yes! Gosh
.

765
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:36,355
- You what? You are useless silent!
- Choose! You have to choose.

766
01:36:37,358 --> 01:36:40,486
You're all useless.
I do not care!

767
01:36:41,262 --> 01:36:42,320
It is important among us.

768
01:36:42,429 --> 01:36:44,294
Yes! You have to choose!

769
01:36:44,365 --> 01:36:48,324
My God, you're pretentious champion here?

770
01:36:48,469 --> 01:36:52,428
Shut up!
Come opponent.

771
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:55,407
Can you shut up!

772
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:00,413
Dead you!

773
01:37:52,333 --> 01:37:54,460
You pretend to sleep.

774
01:38:13,254 --> 01:38:15,415
Not useful.

775
01:38:17,291 --> 01:38:19,452
I have to remove it.

776
01:38:20,394 --> 01:38:25,263
But it was useless. We leave it alone.

777
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:31,397
We can get married.

778
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:37,467
It will menghantammu.
You know.

779
01:39:10,277 --> 01:39:18,241
It's all finished. We've eradicate all pirates
.

780
01:39:18,352 --> 01:39:20,479
And make pirate
feet into our hands.

781
01:39:21,288 --> 01:39:25,349
I think this is a good idea is noble.

782
01:39:25,392 --> 01:39:29,453
Yes, yes, no. But it contaminates us.

783
01:39:30,297 --> 01:39:32,322
Yes, that's right.

784
01:39:32,366 --> 01:39:35,335
They Barbarians must we destroy.
Do you understand?

785
01:39:35,436 --> 01:39:40,373
- I think this is good.
- Think what? This decision.

786
01:39:40,407 --> 01:39:43,274
It defame me.

787
01:39:44,478 --> 01:39:48,380
I do not like it.

788
01:39:51,251 --> 01:39:54,243
I want this.

789
01:39:54,355 --> 01:39:56,346
You can see the rest.

790
01:39:56,423 --> 01:39:59,290
All will be safe,

791
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,225
Do not worry about it.

792
01:40:02,262 --> 01:40:07,427
- You will be safe from the warriors.
- I'll see it.

793
01:40:08,268 --> 01:40:13,399
I'll be happy. This is a very important advantage.

794
01:40:15,342 --> 01:40:16,366
Yes.

795
01:40:16,477 --> 01:40:18,342
Why no women here?

796
01:40:18,412 --> 01:40:21,506
This is my gift. This is me.

797
01:40:22,316 --> 01:40:25,410
Young lady to accompany me.

798
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:31,423
He's good quality.

799
01:40:34,495 --> 01:40:36,463
You're beautiful. You're in luck.

800
01:40:37,264 --> 01:40:39,323
I will be satisfied.

801
01:40:41,301 --> 01:40:43,428
I'm better.

802
01:40:44,438 --> 01:40:47,305
We'll see about that.

803
01:41:08,429 --> 01:41:10,397
It was a beautiful necklace.

804
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:17,360
It's a gift from my mother .
Prize last.

805
01:41:18,472 --> 01:41:20,303
That?

806
01:41:21,442 --> 01:41:23,433
He was killed.

807
01:41:23,544 --> 01:41:24,511
And raped.

808
01:41:25,312 --> 01:41:26,404
What?

809
01:41:26,547 --> 01:41:30,313
My father was killed.

810
01:41:30,417 --> 01:41:36,447
My mother was raped cruel. I
hidden under the house.

811
01:41:38,258 --> 01:41:40,488
Fuck it very badly!

812
01:41:42,463 --> 01:41:47,298
It was then I became independent.

813
01:41:52,372 --> 01:41:57,366
You're pretty strong.
It's bold, it's no wonder.

814
01:42:01,248 --> 01:42:15,254
My family became victims of the killings.
They brutally killed.

815
01:42:15,496 --> 01:42:22,402
I see it all instantly.

816
01:42:27,374 --> 01:42:33,404
Then you're here for revenge?

817
01:42:33,447 --> 01:42:39,477
I will help-you.

818
01:42:41,288 --> 01:42:43,449
What are your goals?

819
01:42:45,325 --> 01:42:50,285
None. Moreover, we can not
away from each other because of this.

820
01:42:52,466 --> 01:42:57,335
Do not you dare touch me when I'm
sleep.

821
01:43:04,411 --> 01:43:11,442
I'm a real man, I would
do it directly in front of you.

822
01:43:17,357 --> 01:43:22,351
- Of course I'm going to ask for permission.
- Do not be presumptuous.

823
01:43:23,263 --> 01:43:26,460
I'm not attracted to you.

824
01:43:26,533 --> 01:43:30,367
- Do you want to pee?
- Yes.

825
01:43:37,344 --> 01:43:45,251
- You've got a nice body.
- Cover your mouth.

826
01:43:45,285 --> 01:43:52,282
Do not think badly,
I just praise you.

827
01:43:52,359 --> 01:43:55,487
I know a jerk like you.

828
01:43:56,496 --> 01:44:02,435
I've experienced a lot of injuries.

829
01:44:03,270 --> 01:44:09,266
- View my wounds.
- Do not think that only you have.

830
01:44:09,309 --> 01:44:11,504
My wound is very large.

831
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:17,273
Look, I also have a like-your wound.

832
01:44:19,419 --> 01:44:29,351
- You can see the wound in my back!
- Well I'll show other injuries.

833
01:44:30,264 --> 01:44:35,497
- You're not nothing.
- See there.

834
01:44:44,344 --> 01:44:50,408
You have to be careful around here.

835
01:44:57,524 --> 01:45:04,453
Members  family, father, mother, and child
will be put to death.

836
01:45:04,498 --> 01:45:07,467
Why did this have to happen?

837
01:45:07,501 --> 01:45:11,403
- You're all going to be put to death.
- I failed.

838
01:45:11,405 --> 01:45:14,465
I can not protect you.

839
01:45:16,476 --> 01:45:24,474
You all will be punished tonight.

840
01:45:25,519 --> 01:45:30,388
- Punishment hanging and burned.
- You?

841
01:45:31,458 --> 01:45:33,358
What ?

842
01:45:35,329 --> 01:45:37,320
What's up?

843
01:45:38,265 --> 01:45:43,259
- There's no nothing.
- Not what?

844
01:45:44,271 --> 01:45:46,239
- Shut up.
- Why?

845
01:45:46,273 --> 01:45:48,434
- Why?
- My butt itches.

846
01:45:51,311 --> 01:45:54,280
- Itching?
- Shut your mouth!

847
01:45:54,314 --> 01:46:02,244
My hands are tied, what can I do?
What I can scratch with my feet?

848
01:46:02,255 --> 01:46:05,349
- Can you help me?
- Forgive him.

849
01:46:05,392 --> 01:46:08,327
- For what you're sorry ?.
- Silence.

850
01:46:08,328 --> 01:46:11,263
For what silence?

851
01:46:12,299 --> 01:46:16,360
- Below. We survived.
- What?

852
01:46:16,470 --> 01:46:23,399
You really want to die quickly.
Warrior! Kill them now!

853
01:46:31,518 --> 01:46:33,452
Come on!

854
01:46:37,491 --> 01:46:40,460
Opened me!

855
01:46:40,494 --> 01:46:47,229
Hey, please open me!
Here!

856
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:50,292
Hey! Opened for my!

857
01:46:56,343 --> 01:46:58,470
Do not come any closer!

858
01:47:04,518 --> 01:47:08,215
Give up if you do not want to die.

859
01:47:10,290 --> 01:47:19,460
- You've all safe now.
- We owe a lot to you.

860
01:47:19,499 --> 01:47:25,301
It is our duty to help each other.

861
01:47:25,338 --> 01:47:30,241
- No need to hesitate.
- Come on, hurry up.

862
01:47:33,313 --> 01:47:38,376
We're even now.

863
01:47:38,485 --> 01:47:45,254
You're free to go.

864
01:47:45,358 --> 01:48:01,264
- Well, thank you for your cooperation.
- You're a good person.

865
01:48:02,509 --> 01:48:13,386
One day fate will bring us again.

866
01:48:17,324 --> 01:48:21,317
We'll see.

867
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:27,365
Come...

868
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:32,394
The most important thing you all survived.

869
01:48:55,428 --> 01:49:01,389
Bad weather.
Appears there will be a storm.

870
01:49:01,535 --> 01:49:09,306
- Better we immediately pulled over.
- Storms will not deter us.

871
01:49:09,376 --> 01:49:12,436
They should fear us.

872
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:17,473
Well...

873
01:49:27,294 --> 01:49:30,354
not possible. Kill him!

874
01:49:31,398 --> 01:49:34,231
Turn directions!

875
01:49:53,386 --> 01:49:58,449
The entire village was destroyed, there was no food.

876
01:49:58,491 --> 01:50:06,398
- We can not find anything here.
- You've checked everything?

877
01:50:06,499 --> 01:50:16,306
It works kaisarjahat it.

878
01:50:16,343 --> 01:50:18,243
- What do we do?
- Let's attack them.

879
01:50:18,278 --> 01:50:30,452
- Do not do it.
- We live to defend our neighbor.

880
01:50:30,457 --> 01:50:36,396
We just  captive and almost died.

881
01:50:37,364 --> 01:50:41,357
I will go alone.

882
01:50:41,401 --> 01:50:48,466
- I'm with you. Let's go!
- Where are we going?

883
01:51:01,354 --> 01:51:06,291
- He should die!
- Yes!

884
01:51:06,326 --> 01:51:11,423
- We do not kill animals!
- He is an enemy spy.

885
01:51:15,368 --> 01:51:23,503
I am the captain of this ship, you have no right
. Prepare the cannons!

886
01:51:23,543 --> 01:51:25,408
Yes!

887
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:57,239
- Captain, there!
- What is it?

888
01:51:57,243 --> 01:52:02,476
- Hold attack.

889
01:52:05,318 --> 01:52:09,482
- Prepare your weapon!

891
01:52:10,490 --> 01:52:13,254
This time he will die.

892
01:52:18,231 --> 01:52:20,256
Shoot!

893
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:22,325
Attack!

894
01:52:29,442 --> 01:52:33,344

895
01:52:42,422 --> 01:52:45,255

01:53:25,498 --> 01:53:29,332
Throw a grenade!

902
01:54:02,468 --> 01:54:07,405
- Captain, there is a storm.
- We have to get out of here.

903
01:54:07,473 --> 01:54:12,342
Do not worry, we'll be fine.

904
01:54:13,279 --> 01:54:16,510
- Lift them.
- Lift this whale!

905
01:54:16,516 --> 01:54:18,381
Yes!

906

Pull with a vengeance!
Come on!

907
01:54:25,425 --> 01:54:28,451
You, this is not your boat!

908
01:54:31,464 --> 01:54:36,458
- You invade me now?
- Because you're too selfish.

909
01:54:36,502 --> 01:54:42,270
I'll tell you one thing.
Yamada, here!

910
01:54:44,510 --> 01:54:52,417
I store explosives in
down there, let us die together.

911
01:54:52,518 --> 01:54:58,320
You decide.

I'm not afraid of your threats. After I killed your

913
01:55:10,536 --> 01:55:13,334
They are all me.

01:55:27,287 --> 01:55:31,246
Storm and enemy ships.

915
01:55:48,341 --> 01:55:50,366
Brother.

916
01:55:50,376 --> 01:55:52,241
It's okay.

917
01:55:53,313 --> 01:55:54,371
Are you okay?

Kill them all!

926
01:58:48,287 --> 01:58:52,485

Good job.

There are things you want.
Take it and get out of here.

934
02:00:30,489 --> 02:00:34,255
Quick.

935
02:00:35,361 --> 02:00:37,226
Quick!

936
02:01:14,433 --> 02:01:17,459
Skip, this ship will explode!

937
02:01:18,237 --> 02:01:20,467

02:01:22,508 --> 02:01:27,275
Goodbye.

940
02:01:45,398 --> 02:01:50,495
It has become our end.

941
02:02:20,466 --> 02:02:22,525
Successfully!

942
02:03:08,381 --> 02:03:14,342
Do not yell, or
I will kill you.

943
02:03:17,423 --> 02:03:24,352
I just want to talk to you.

944
02:03:26,298 --> 02:03:32,294
Why are you torturing small people?

945
02:03:32,338 --> 02:03:47,447
They were tortured , you squeeze your people
itself. For your well-being.

946
02:03:50,322 --> 02:03:56,386
I'm here to punish your.

947
02:03:56,495 --> 02:04:06,370
I'm here to defend the people.

948
02:04:30,362 --> 02:04:35,390
What have you done?

949
02:04:35,434 --> 02:04:37,459
Forgive us.

950
02:04:37,503 --> 02:04:39,471
Answer me!

951
02:04:46,512 --> 02:04:54,385
You will be put to death.

952
02:04:54,386 --> 02:04:58,413
- We beg pardon, sire.
- Shut up!

953
02:04:58,491 --> 02:05:03,360
- You want to make this country destroyed.
- What?

954
02:05:03,395 --> 02:05:07,229
Close your mouth.

955
02:05:07,266 --> 02:05:13,432
You have no right to speak.

956
02:05:13,472 --> 02:05:16,498
You just deserve to die.

957
02:05:18,410 --> 02:05:22,244
We beg mercy.

958
02:05:22,281 --> 02:05:23,407
We're screwed.

959
02:05:41,400 --> 02:05:43,265
Hey!

960
02:05:43,302 --> 02:05:47,238
- Why are you hanging on a rope?
- I'm working!

961
02:05:47,273 --> 02:05:51,334
Do it right.
Use the force.

962
02:05:51,377 --> 02:05:55,404
- He is very noisy.
- Go to work.

963
02:05:55,447 --> 02:05:58,439
My goodness, I will reply to your later.

964
02:05:58,484 --> 02:06:04,286
- He totally useless.
- He can only use his mouth.

965
02:06:05,291 --> 02:06:07,521
Totally useless.
